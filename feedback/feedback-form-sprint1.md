## FEEDBACK FORM: TEST 1

### Section 1: How and when was feedback provided?

Feedback was released on 18 October 2018 by email and through the Grade Centre on Blackboard.

### Section 2: General Feedback

In general, results were very good. Congratulations!

There was a comment on the meaning of `they` in the statement `team members are accountable for the work they plan and carry out`, `they` was intended to mean each individual member independently of gender. However, `they` can also refer to the plural pronoun in this case without affecting the correctness of the statement.

#### Retrospective exercise on sprint 1

This is an exercise to reflect on the first sprint: we'd like to hear what went well and suggestions for improving your learning experience.

Also we would like you to help us elect a **sprint leader** among the TAs in the module. Please choose your favourite one and provide a brief justification. The sprint leader will also get a CO2006 mascot! :wink: 

Please fill in [this survey](https://bit.ly/2AiKicR) by end of tomorrow, Friday 18 Oct.

#### Looking forwards

We are going to use **Gradle** to configure Java projects in sprint 2. Quite often we will use it to import already configured projects although you will have the chance to create Java web app projects from scratch.

**Groovy** is going to be used for writing build scripts in Gradle in the rest of the module and for writing test suites in sprint 3 using the Spock framework. 

### Section 3: Individual feedback  

Individual marks have been sent by email, the mark of sprint 1 consists of two components:
* effort (5%) out of three lab exercises
* test (95%)

The mark of sprint 1 accounts for 15% of the overall module mark.

Solutions to exercises can be reached via the Grade centre, click on the mark for the test and you will be forwarded to a page with your solutions and with the correct answers.
